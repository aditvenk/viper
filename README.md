# viper
The colonial viper is the primary fighter spacecraft of the Colonists in Battlestar Galactica. Apart from combating the Cylons, the Vipers also serve several other functions such as scouting new routes, exploring new planets etc. Their lightweight and quick launch capability serves them well in their varied roles. Similarly, the viper toolkit will be a lightweight toolkit for developing quick and dirty machine learning models.
It has been inspired by equivalent functions in Octave and will use highly vectorized techniques for high performance.
